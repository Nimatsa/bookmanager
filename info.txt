Project details:

design and implement a management system for a book store, we'll use
pdf instead of real books, makes more sense

what is expected of this system? to manage information about books,
writers, customers and sales.

expected options:

1_ Manage books:
    adding new books [ ]
    displaying list of books [ ]
    book details: book id, title, writer, price [ ]

2_ Manage writers:
    publish writer details ( using a separate class, with inheritance ) [ ]
    display list of writers [ ]

3_ Manage customers:
    adding new customer [ ]
    display list of customers [ ]

4_ register and report sales:
    register info of book sales ( book id, date, number, price ) [ ]
    display sale report, ( how much a book id sells, total sales ) [ ]
