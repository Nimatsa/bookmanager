lets manage the adding book part

so we receive a title and a link to github, then the useless details
like writer and price (free btw). then we assign an incrementing id,
it meants we start counting from 1.


*books are the created object, with title, writer, price, id.

ultimately it's a derived class, from a higher one with add book method
and display book list method.
